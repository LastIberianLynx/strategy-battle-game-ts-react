we have 3 attacks per turn, and a specific resource gives more attacks per turn. Could be the crown.

Then we have the units, peasants, archer, cavalry, pikeman, swords.

the strongest is the cavalry.

alt1:
you need food match to get peasants, then you need wood match to get arrows.
then you could combine 1 peasant and 1 wood and get an archer.
Cavalry needs 1 peasant, 2 iron, 1 horse.

alt2:
or we could simply build a ui, that buys the units you need, according to the resources you made.
But there we need the resources to also escalate, like in tower swap, and have more combinations, that give more resources.

-

As you get units, you get to employ them in battle.

alt1: units are employed only once in battle and then they are gone.

alt2: units are employed in battle and then need to rest for 2 battles.

alt3: only units that are promoted can be used the next battle.
