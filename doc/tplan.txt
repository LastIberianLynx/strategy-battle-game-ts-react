we will make the enemy fire shots at us?
hmmm

make and test onager script.

Now communicate bonuses.
Get terrain bonuses.
communicate who's turn.
fix health to 100%.

then work on candy crush, with the new ideas of react, where you communicate with the render properly.

https://react.dev/learn/queueing-a-series-of-state-updates
do all these exercises before candy crush game.

now need to make archer fire from far away, 
and make enemy AI do it too... 

thats going to be hard.

need to hook keys awsd

maybe to fix the error, just detect it as 100%, and add message regenerated.

would be nice also to rotate the units when we attack. though that might cause even more bugs.

-


now it seems i cant attack and retreat. it becomes out of moves after one attack?
thats how conw does.

do you want to make the ranged attack? or we leave it as is?

-

There is still the issue of AI overlapping units.
And with AI moving my units sometimes.

should make skip turn mechanic.
should also account for units that AI tried to move.

---


now the Piece will move towards the closest enemy,
Later i should also take into account the combat utility (the defense and the attack of each unit).
To decide the best AI move.

make it also skip turn sometimes.

need a function for AI get units in danger.

there was a bug where the unit killed my unit but then it ressurrected so weird.

---

fix terrain bonuses.
make an utility ai, check all enemy units, check all human units, analyze the ones i have bonus against and then check distance and make
the distance have an influence on the value.

--

create text message that spawns in a x and a y and disappears.

if that works we might do that to render stars of experience.

then do the combat perfectly.

then do the turns, and AI

keep the black squares, maybe for an effect make another component called, terrain, and mimick everything using the images code.

-

avoid terrain repetition.
make the combat work properly.
and the turns and ai.
and a new component for the xp.

the combat is done.
though when we move a piece, we should now disable its movement.
could also make it so that it shows the spots where it can move, thats in the tuts. 
But its not relevant yet.

the piece needs the moves or at least if it already moved this turn.

---

now need to make it have a hue maybe. for the other faction.
and then need to make the combat work properly.
and the ai that simply advances at random.
would be nice to also have the damage numbers.
though im afraid that might cause some issues.
then we need a way to combine both the candy crush and this one.
maybe have them as separate apps communicating with each other.

-


maybe try to find a way to instead of dragging we just select, and spawn a selection effect on top of the selected pawn.
that way the pawn doesnt move with it i think.
